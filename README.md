# Dynamic_Traffic_Zonebased
TrafficFlowAnalyzer is a Python-based tool that leverages the YOLO object detection model to analyze traffic flow in video footage. It allows users to define specific traffic zones (light, moderate, heavy) and counts the number of vehicles passing through each zone in real-time. vehicles are assigned  weight based on their effect on traffic  flow.
